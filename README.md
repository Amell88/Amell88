 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Amell's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

Initiating my professional coding journey, my passion for technology was ignited by the aspiration to unravel complex financial challenges. Originating from a robust background in finance, particularly within the investment sector, I discovered the potent intersection of technology and finance. This realization fueled my inquisitiveness, propelling me to enroll in Moringa School's Data Science Program Bootcamp, spanning from early April 2023 to February 2024.

Throughout my tenure at Moringa School, I immersed myself in a multitude of projects—approximately 30 in total. Notably, I consistently demonstrated excellence, securing the top position in my class on numerous occasions. As the curriculum evolved into the realm of deep learning, I found myself entranced by the nuances of deep learning frameworks. This newfound passion impelled me to explore diverse deep learning projects, encompassing Natural Language Processing (NLP), Time Series analysis utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

At present, my endeavors are focused on spearheading projects involving deep CNN, chatbots, and the development of bespoke deep learning models tailored to provide innovative solutions within the financial sector. The convergence of finance and deep learning stands as a central theme in my journey, where my objective is to contribute inventive solutions to challenges within my field.

As I navigate the intricate landscape of this evolving industry, there remains an unwavering commitment to continuous improvement. My trajectory as a Machine Learning Engineer, specializing in investment data and machine learning, unfolds as an exhilarating path brimming with boundless possibilities.
